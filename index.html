    <p> Hey, I'm Ian and this is my personal project</p><br>
    <p> If you're having trouble finding legitimate jobs on Linked In, then this is for you. 
        I Intend to make this a reddit for jobs. 
        You can post and even link jobs that you came across on Linked In or any other jobs platform and yout rating/comment about it. 
        This website is meant to help job seekers avoid scams and ghost jobs especially in today's Job market.   
    </p><br>
    <p> I'm a beginner learning as I go so this might take a while to finish. 
        Stay tuned......
